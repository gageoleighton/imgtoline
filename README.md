# imgtoline
Computationally determine lines of best fit through an image
This is not the best approach for large images since it is very computationally expensive.

# Install the required packages
```
# Python 2.7+ and packages
pip install pillow tkinter cv2 numpy skimage matplotlib

# Simply launch the program and select your desired image
python img2lines.py


# I'm working on using networkx to determine, also not the best solution
pip install networkx
```
